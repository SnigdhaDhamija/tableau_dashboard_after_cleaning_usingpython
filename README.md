Bike Rentals Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bike rental data using Python for data cleaning and Tableau for dashboard visualization. The goal is to derive insights from rental patterns and trends.

Files in this Repository

Cleaning_the_dataset_using_python_libraries.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data cleaning techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The dataset undergoes preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

Dashboard on Bike Rentals-2.twbx

A Tableau workbook that visualizes the cleaned bike rental data.

It includes interactive charts and dashboards to explore rental trends, peak usage times, and other key insights.

Prerequisites

To work with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.x) and Jupyter Notebook

Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Tableau (for opening the .twbx file)

How to Use

Open Cleaning_the_dataset_using_python_libraries.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to clean and preprocess the data.

Open Dashboard on Bike Rentals-2.twbx in Tableau to explore the visualizations and insights derived from the cleaned data.

Insights & Findings

The cleaned dataset reveals peak rental hours and seasonal trends.

The Tableau dashboard provides a clear visualization of user behavior and demand patterns.

Identifying high-demand time periods helps in resource allocation and planning.
